<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Lee Schlosser and I am a new Web Developer. I started learning
  about coding because I want to make an app that will track various things I do
  throughout the week so that at the end of the week I know how much time I
  spent on those things, such as learning to code.

  I'm excited to learn more about coding and I love that there will always be
  something new to learn! I started learning to code in June 2023 with a course
  I heard about on Udemy. I was listening to a podcast about self taught
  programmers and one of them suggested a course taught by Angela Yu from App
  Brewery.

  So far I've only learned a little about back end and mostly about HTML and
  next on the list is CSS. I feel like this will be really fun for me the more I
  learn. I have a background in making art and producing music, which I feel
  like will translate in abstract ways when it comes to coding. I would love to
  make some friends who are either new like me or are professionals, it would be
  fun to talk with people about my new passion.
