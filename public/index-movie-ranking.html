  A man and his journey through life. This movie always makes me cry like a
  million times.

  This was the first R-rated movie I ever watched. This movie had a profound
  effect on me and got me to start thinking outside of the box.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>

  This movie to me is about how to face your fears and to help others and
  forgive people who have hurt you. My 3 year old daughter also loves this movie
  and refers to the river spirit as ''Poo Poo Monster'' so this movie is now
  titled the ''Poo Poo Monster Movie''.
